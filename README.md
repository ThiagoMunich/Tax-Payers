## Problem
Make a program to read the data of *N* taxpayers (*N* provided by the user), which can be individuals or legal entities, and then show the amount of tax paid by each one, as well as the total tax collected. <br/><br/>
**Data for individuals:** name, annual income and health expenses.<br/>
**Data for legal entities:** name, annual income and number of employees.<br/><br/>
Use the following rules for calculating fees:<br/><br/>
**Individual:** people whose income was below $20000.00 should pay 15% tax. People with an income of $20000.00 onwards should pay 25% tax. If the person had health expenses, 50% of these expenses are deducted from the tax.<br/><br/>
**Legal entity:** legal entities pays 16% tax. However, if the company has more than 10 employees, it should pay 14% tax.<br/>
